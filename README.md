# Airbnb-Analysis using Tableau
**Airbnb Insights: An Interactive Analysis of Pricing, Availability, and Location Trends**
#
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data to uncover insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. By leveraging Python for data processing and visualization, and tools like Streamlit, Tableau for interactive visualizations, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

Clean the dataset by addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and performing necessary data type conversions to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

**Conduct Price Analysis and Visualization:**

Analyze pricing variations based on location, property type, room type and accommodation. Create dynamic plots and charts to visualize these variations and identify trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.

**Analyze Availability Patterns by Market:**

Examine the availability of Airbnb listings across different seasons. Visualize occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations throughout the year using suitable visualizations such as pie charts and heatmaps.

**Investigate Location-Based Insights:**

Extract and visualize data for specific regions or market to understand how the price of listings varies across different locations.

**Create Interactive Visualizations:**

Develop dynamic visualizations that allow users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences, enabling them to explore specific regions, property types, or time periods of interest.

**Build a Comprehensive Dashboard:**

Use Tableau public to create a dashboard that combines various visualizations, presenting key insights from the analysis in a user-friendly and interactive manner.

**Develop a Streamlit Web Application:**

Create an interactive web application that embeds a Tableau dashboard, enabling users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

# Objectives:

**Pricing Analysis:** Determine how prices vary based on location, property type, and seasons.

**Availability Patterns:** Understand occupancy rates and demand fluctuations across different times of the year.

**Location-Based Trends:** Identify insights and trends specific to regions or market.

**User Interactivity:** Enable users to interact with visualizations and explore the data dynamically.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the travel, property management, and tourism industries, helping them make data-driven decisions and optimize their strategies based on the analysis.
